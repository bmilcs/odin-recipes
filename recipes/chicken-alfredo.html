  <p>Tender chicken breasts atop a bed of fettuccine noodles smothered in a creamy alfredo sauce, this chicken alfredo recipe
  is comforting and overly satisfying!</p>

  <p>Classic chicken alfredo is one of those recipes people can’t seem to get enough of. Golden brown pan-seared chicken
  paired with rich cheesy alfredo and fettuccine noodles all seasoned to flavorful perfection is hard to top! It’s a belly
  filler and a recipe we come back to again and again for an easy weeknight meal.</p>
